Puts fingers in ears and sings la-la-la-la-la-la. In recent years there has been
a big debate over web vs. native. And to be fair, it was never an even game. The
web was always lacking behind: there was no story for offline; it was impossible
to make a nice OS integration; and you could not access the features that make a
phone so cool like sensors, or the GSM radio. Now that is going to change,
Mozilla is building Firefox OS, a mobile operating system solely built on top of
web technology. And that means: new APIs for all the things missing on the web!
Talking to sensors, making a phone call, etc. All from JavaScript.

But, how does a call from a client side application (in JS) gets routed to the
actual hardware? In this presentation Jan Jongboom will guide you from calling a
JavaScript functions all the way down to the radio chipset, explaining the
architecture of Firefox OS on the way.
